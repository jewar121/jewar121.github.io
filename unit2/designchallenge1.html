<h1>What are two websites layout and design that I admire</h1><br>
<a href="http://www.yuengling.com">yuengling.com</a> <a href="http://www.theonion.com/">theonion.com</a>
<p>The large element of the yuengling page is its user interactions. The visual balance focuses to this area and shows what the website is all about. Reexamining it there could be even more emphasis to the interacting element.

The onion has very heavy white space framing the many articles in an organized fashion. Its kept simple to not as to take away from the stories themselves. Reexamining it a balancing with less articles could be possible.
</p>
<h2>What makes them similar and diffrent</h2>
<p>The onion uses a three column grid and flows from the more recent fake news to the less recent. 

Yuengling has no grid and the focal point is on the flashy images and brand. 
</p><p>
Similarly it is easy to get around both sites from the index page and find what your looking for.
