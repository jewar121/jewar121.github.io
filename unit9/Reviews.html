<h1>Shadow of Mordor</h1>

<P>

One Uruk killed me four times each time gaining power and <br>joking about how many times he had to kill me. <br><br>

Another Uruk called a crowd of Uruks to help everytime I encountered him. He didn't even speak, just biting noises which might have been more terrifying. I had to get stronger before I took him down.<br><br>

Another time I was fighting two captains at the same time and had two other captains ambush me, ones that had already killed me before. I had to run away and try to separate them so I could pick them off. 
Eventually I managed to kill three of the four.
<br><br>

These are some of the moments from the nemesis system that make this game great.</P>

<h1>Walking Dead</h1>
<h2>"Strangers"</h2>

<p>


I hate when on a show people go through all kinds of trouble to get something only to have it taken away. So after the group grabbed the food from the basement flooded with grotesque walkers and water, I was honestly more worried about whether someone would steal the food from them on the way back. Not if somebody dies or get bitten.</P>
